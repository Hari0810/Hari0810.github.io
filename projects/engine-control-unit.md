## Overview

This project involved the design and firmware development of an Engine Control Unit
for a liquid bipropellant rocket engine.

## Key Features

- STM32 microcontroller
- 1 Mbps CAN bus
- 24V / 2A solenoid valve drivers
- High-speed SPI sensors (10 MHz)

## My Contributions

- CAN protocol implementation
- Hardware bring-up and debugging
- Firmware architecture and safety checks

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of deterministic timing
- Debugging mixed hardware–software faults
