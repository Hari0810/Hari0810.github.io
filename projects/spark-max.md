# SPARK MAX Motor Controller - A Guide
 
A guide to using the REV Robotics device outside the FRC ecosystem, as well as a thorough breakdown and reverse-engineering of the internals.

## Overview

Ever since I posted on Reddit about how I was able to use Arduino to control a Spark Max outside of FRC uses, I’ve had quite a few questions about it, so I will go through the entire setup and methodology here.
